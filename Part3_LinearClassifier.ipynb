    "Now that we have implemented our loss function and it's gradient, we can finally train our model.\n",

    "  which are set in advance and trainable parameters which we want to fit to data.\n",

    "- In this exercise we'll have separated the loss and dataset, however for simplicity we'll implement the\n",
    "  model and optimizer together.\n",
    "- As you'll see further on, `PyTorch` provides very effective mechanisms to implement all of\n",
    "  these components in a decoupled manner.\n",
    "- Note that our loss implementation didn't include regularization. We'll add this during the training phase\n",
    "  using the `weight_decay` parameter. The reason is that we prefer that the part of the loss which only depends\n",
    "  on the model parameters be part of the optimizer, not the loss function (though both ways are possible).\n",
    "  You'll see this pattern later on when you use `PyTorch`'s optimizers in the `torch.optim` package.\n",
    "- In practice we use batches of samples from the training set when training the model, because usually the training\n",
    "  set can't fit into memory. Using gradients computed on batches of data at a time is known as mini-batch\n",
    "  stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
